# Data Visualization Practice: Stacked Area Chart in Excel

This repository contains practice work I am doing to learn data visualization using random datasets. The focus here is on creating and interpreting **Stacked Area Charts** in Excel.

## What is a Stacked Area Chart?
A **Stacked Area Chart** is a visualization that displays quantitative data in a way that emphasizes the magnitude of change over time, while also showing the composition of multiple data series. It's especially useful when comparing the contribution of individual data series to the whole over time.

## Visualization Example:
Here are some examples of stacked area charts created using Excel:

### Example 1:

## Learning Objectives:
- Understanding how to visualize time-series data with stacked areas.
- Gaining proficiency in Excel's charting tools.
- Analyzing how individual components contribute to overall trends.

## Tools Used:
- **Excel**: For creating stacked area charts and analyzing data.
- **Data Analysis**: Using random datasets to explore various visualization techniques.
